# Computational Statistics (R)

This project contains generalized R implementations of core computational statistics methods.
The code is written from scratch for learning and demonstration (not tied to a specific course assignment).

## Topics
- Simulation & random number generation
- Monte Carlo estimation
- Bootstrap & resampling
- Numerical optimization

## How to run
Open the scripts in each topic folder and run in R/RStudio.

## Tools
R, base R, tidyverse (optional)
